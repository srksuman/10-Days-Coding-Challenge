#  Python | yield Keyword
Yield is a Python keyword that allows you to exit a function without destroying the state of any local variables.
* It stores the local variable states, hence overhead of memory allocation is controlled
* The old state is retained, the flow doesnâ€™t start from the beginning and hence saves time
