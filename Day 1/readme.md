## RegEx in Python
A RegEx, or Regular Expression, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. Python has a built-in package called re, which can be used to work with Regular Expressions.


### RegEx Functions

**search** --> Returns matching object if there in the string

**findall** --> Return all list matching

**split** --> Returns a list of matches where the string has been split

**sub** --> Replace matches with string
